      Good news! One of our expert instructors, <%=@lesson.instructor.name %>, has confirmed your lesson request. Please review your instructor's info and the details of your lesson below, and don't be afraid to <a href="mailto:hello@snowschoolers.com">reach out to us</a> if you have any questions. You may also reach your instructor directly the day of your lesson using their contact info below.
    </p>

    <h4>What happens next?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your lesson will begin promptly at the start time you've selected.</li>
      <li>If you are renting from the mountain, please plan to arrive at the ski hill at least <%= ENV['RENTAL_ADVANCE_TIME'] %> prior to your lesson so that you can get outfitted with your equipment. For afternoon lessons, if it is at all possible please come by in the morning before 1030am to pickup your equipment, because rental equipment selection is often extremely limited in the afternoon. When you arrive, please tell one of our staff your name and and your reservation confirmation# (below), and they'll be able to check you in.</li>
      <li>If you have your own equipment, you should still arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the start of your lesson to afford enough time to find parking and put on your boots and gear.</li>
    </ul>

      Reservation confirmation number: <span style="font-size:18px;"><%=@lesson.confirmation_number%></span>
