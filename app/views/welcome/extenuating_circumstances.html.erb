	<h2 class="underline"><b>December 2020 Update - Re: California Shelter-in-place Orders</b></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Despite the shelter-in-place directive that most counties in California are currently under, Snow Schoolers will remain open at both our Granlibakken and Kingvale locations.
		</li>
		<li>
			We have adopted industry standard best practices to ensure both our guests and employees' safety. These include mandatory mask-wearing for all employees at all times. Guests likewise must have a mask to enter, and are expected to wear their mask whenever social distancing is not physically possible (e.g. lift lines, etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Snow Schoolers and the Granlibakken Ski Hill are classified as ski operators, and are accordingly exempted from a forced business shutdown during the shelter-in-place order. The full advisory notice from the state of California for ski operators can be found here: <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds-outdoor-recreation--en.pdf" class="navy-link">https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds-outdoor-recreation--en.pdf</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			While we do plan to remain open, we expect and understand that many of our guests may be unable to visit us over the coming weeks due to the necessary travel restrictions that are part of the order. If your ability to travel to Tahoe is forbidden due to the shelter-in-place order, please reach out to our guest services team by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@snowschoolers.com"> hello@snowschoolers.com</a>. 
		</li>
		<li>
			We appreciate your patience in advance as we are already experiencing a high volume of questions. We'll be answering questions in the order they come in, with an additional priority for bookings whose lesson date is fast-approaching.
		</li>

	<h2 class="underline">Extenuating Circumstances that require documentation</h2>
	<ul>

You’ll be asked to provide a statement from a physician confirming that the person can't host or travel due to an unexpected, serious illness or injury.

			<b>Natural disasters, terrorist activity, and civil/political unrest </b> that prevent the guest from traveling to or from the destination, or that make it unsafe to host guests.
